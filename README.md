# print-edge-list-on-Java
In this assignment, I worked on Input.txt file which contains 3 columns and 32836 rows. First and Second columns represents the ids of people and 3rd column shows the strength of relationship amount these people. By using Input.txt we need to create a weighted graph, where ids will be node ids and strength of the relationship will be edge weights. 1) For this purpose, you need to write 3 classes Node.java, Edge.java and Graph.java. 2) Write a program that print edge list (as linkedlist) to a file named Output.txt file
